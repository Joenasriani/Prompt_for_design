## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

Are you tired of getting unpredictable or mediocre results from AI animation tools like Runway, Pika Labs, or Stable Diffusion Video? The problem often lies in the prompt. Simple prompts like "a robot walking" leave too much to the AI's imagination, resulting in wasted time and credits.

This course teaches you the **SC SMELL Framework**, a systematic approach to prompt engineering that gives you precise control over your output, ensuring the final animation matches your creative vision.

## 🤔 What is the SC SMELL Framework?

SC SMELL is an acronym for the seven essential components of a master-level AI animation prompt. By defining each element, you leave no room for error.

* **🎭 S - Scene:** The "what" and "where." Describe the subject, action, location, and key details.
* **📹 C - Camera:** The perspective. Define the shot type (close-up, wide), angle, and movement (pan, dolly).
* **🎨 S - Style:** The visual aesthetic. Specify the art style (photorealistic, anime), color palette, and quality.
* **💫 M - Motion:** The movement characteristics. Describe the primary and secondary actions, speed, and quality (fluid, mechanical).
* **😊 E - Emotion:** The mood and atmosphere. Set the tone (joyful, tense, mysterious) and energy level.
* **💡 L - Lighting:** The illumination. Define the light source (natural, neon), quality (soft, harsh), and color temperature.
* **⚙️ L - Limits:** The technical specifications. Set the duration, aspect ratio (9:16, 16:9), and frame rate.
